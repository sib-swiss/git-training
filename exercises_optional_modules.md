# Exercises - Git advanced topics: optional modules

<br>

[[_TOC_]]

<br>

## Exercise 5 - The Git reference web page gets better with submodules [40 min]
**Objective:** introduction to git submodule.

In this exercise, we will implement some improvements to 2 web pages using **submodules**. The
projects for these web pages are the following:
* The [git resource webpage](https://github.com/sibgit/git_resources_webpage), which you might
  remember from the *Version Control with Git â€“ First Steps* exercises.
* The [useful tools webpage](https://github.com/sibgit/useful-tools), a page that shows a list of
  useful tools for the part of our lives that does not involve typing Git commands in a shell.

<br>

### A) Clone the projects - including their submodule
* Change into the `exercise_5` directory - it should be empty.
* Clone the repositories for the 2 web pages (see links above). They contain submodules, so
  **make sure to also download the submodule content**.
* Display the two web-pages `references.html` and `useful-tools.html` in your local browser (one is
  in each of the repo you just cloned). They should both show a *glitter effect* when moving the
  mouse pointer.
* Have a look at `.gitmodules` to see what submodules are in these projects.

**Questions**:
* Which command would you use to update the content of the `git_resources_webpage` and
  `useful-tools` repositories (so that changes also affect submodules)?
* Where would you need to run this command? In the main project (e.g. `git_resources_webpage`) or
  inside the `glitter-cursor` submodule directory?

<br>

### B) Change the style of the web sites by adding a submodule
* Go to [the great-style GitHub page](https://github.com/sibgit/great-style) in your browser and
  create a **Fork** of the project. To create a fork, simply go to the web page of "great-style"
  and click on the **Fork** button (near the top right).
* This will create **a copy** of the original project under your GitHub/GitLab account. You will
  be the **owner** of this forked project.
* Add the **forked** *great-style* repo as a new submodule to both `git_resources_webpage` and
  `useful-tools`.  
  :fire: **Important:** make sure to use the **forked** project, and *not* the original project!
* Refresh the two web pages in your browser, they should now have another style.
* **Commit** the changes (i.e. the addition of the new submodule) in your two local repos
  (`git_resources_webpage` and `useful-tools`) with the commit message
  `"Add great-style submodule"`.
* Have again a look at the `.gitmodules` files to see how they changed.

<br>

### C) Improve the great-style submodule
If you look at your web pages, you can notice that the colors of the hyperlinks change rather
quickly, to the point where we cannot enjoy this mesmerizing great style to its full extent. So
let's slow that down a bit.

We will first do the changes from within the project `git_resources_webpage` and then pull the
latest version of the submodule in `useful-tools`.
* Open the file `git_resources_webpage/great-style/great_style.css` in a text editor, and change
  the `--anim-cicle-time` value to 10s (line 4 of the file).
* Reload the web page *references.html* in your browser, and verify that the colors now change
  more slowly.  
* Wait... did we just make a great style even greater? *Yes, we did !*  
  Let's keep these changes for posterity by committing them to the `great_style` submodule and then
  pushing them to the remote (your forked *great-style* remote).  
  **Note:** if you get a message telling you that you are not allowed to push, then it's probably
  because you have added the original *great-style* project as a remote, and not the forked version.
* Almost done. All that is left to is to update the *git_resources_webpage* repository so that it
  points at the new version of *great-style* that we just committed.  
  Go back to the root of `git_resources_webpage`, and commit the changes (the update in the version
  of the *great-style* submodule) with the message
  `"Update great-style submodule with slowed-down color changes"`  

**Question**: in the current setup, you cannot push the changes in `git_resources_webpage` to the
remote repo because you do not have write permission on it. However, if you did, what would be
the command to push your changes in both *git-resources* and its submodules all at once?

Finally, you should now update the *great-style* submodule also in your local `useful-tools`
repository:
* Enter the `useful-tools` repo and get the new version of the *great-style* submodule.
* Reload the page *useful-tools.html* in your browser and verify that the colors now also change
  more slowly.
* Commit your changes.

## Exercise 6 - Git LFS (Large File Storage)
**Objective:** learn to use Git LFS in two different use cases: starting with a Git repo from
scratch, and starting with an already existing Git repo.

### A) Create a new Git repository from scratch with Git LFS file tracking [20 min]
In this first part of the exercise, you are asked to create a new Git repository from scratch,
and have certain types of files tracked by Git LFS.

1. Change directory to `exercise_6/test_lfs.git`. Initialize a new empty Git repository, and make
   a first commit that only adds the `README.md` file.

   **Important:** if you have not run the `git lfs install` command yet (at least once) on your
   system, please do it now.

2. Make a second commit that adds all files present in the directory. However, the following files
   should be tracked by Git LFS (and not by Git directly):
    * all `.fasta` files located in the directory.
    * the `logo.png` file.
    * the `db_file.txt` located in the `db` sub-directory.
   <br>

3. Display the list of files tracked by Git LFS. Verify that the correct files are being tracked
   (you should have a total of 4 LFS-tracked files).

4. Display the content of your latest commit with `git show HEAD`.  
   **Question:** why is the content of the files tracked by Git LFS not displayed?

5. Make some edits to both `README.md` (e.g add a line with some text) and
   `sequences/sample_A.fasta` (e.g. delete a few lines from the file). Then make a new commit with
   these modifications, and display the difference between your last commit and the one just before
   using the `git diff` command.

   **Question:** what is the difference in the way that `git diff` displays the differences between
   regular files and files tracked by Git LFS?

<br>

### B) Migrate an existing directory to Git LFS [40 min]
In this part of the exercise, you will start with an existing Git repo named `arctic_animals.git`.
As its name suggests, this repo contains images of arctic animals in different formats.

1. Explore the history of the Git repository located at `exercise_6/arctic_animals.git` and
   check the following:
    * How many branches are there in the repository?
    * Are there any files that are not currently tracked by Git in the working tree?
    * Run the commands: `du -sh .git/objects` and `du -sh .git`. What is the size of the Git
      "object store" at this point (and the size of the entire git database)?

      **Note:** `.git/objects` is Git's "object store", the part of its database where it stores
      the actual data contained in the files it keeps track of (in terms of space usage, the other
      parts of the git database are small, as they essentially contain pointers to the objects
      kept in the object store).

   <br>

2. We now want to use the `git lfs migrate` command on the `arctic_animals.git` Git repo so that
   all image files (`.tif` and `.jpg`) become tracked by Git LFS rather than by Git itself.

    * Before starting the migration, run `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` (so we can
      later compare the commit ID values before and after the migration).
    * Re-write the repo's history with `git lfs migrate`, move all `.tif` and `.jpg` files to
      Git LFS.
    * Run `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`. Compare the commit ID values with what
      you had before the migration. You should see that all commits in the history of the repo
      are now different.

3. Try to open the image files located in `mammals` and `birds`: can you see the images? If you
   cannot, that is normal, because files are replaced by their pointers during the migration.

    * Run the correct `git lfs` command to restore the files in the working directory.
    * List all files that are tracked by Git LFS. Make sure they are all `.tif` and `.jpg` files.
      If the migration went correctly, you should be tracking the following files with Git LFS:
        ```
        ea67d4f8a5 * birds/animal_atlantic_puffin.tif
        8c92a37ac7 * birds/animal_snowy_owl.jpg
        6b58d6ac09 - fish/animal_pink_salmon.tif
        510d5b477b * logo.jpg
        1aa9297470 * mammals/animal_arctic_fox.jpg
        2519e9a194 - mammals/animal_blue_whale.tif
        47f090bd68 - mammals/animal_muskox.jpg
        3e45f949e2 * mammals/animal_walrus.tif
        4cf1383168 - birds/animal_emperor_penguin.tif
        642c1360fe - birds/animal_gentoo_penguin.jpg
        ```
    * Let's check the size of the Git object store again, as well as the size of the LFS object
      cache (i.e. the directory that contains a cached copy of the files tracked by LFS).
      You can get the respective sizes of these directories with:
      ```
      du -sh .git/objects
      du -sh .git/lfs
      ```

      **Note:** as you can see, the data seems now to be duplicated between the LFS cache and the
      git object store, because the size of the object store has not decreased compared to when we
      first checked-it. However, this is only temporary: at some point Git will do
      garbage-collection of all the commits from the old history, and the copy of the files
      present in the `.git/objects` directory will be removed.  
      To force immediate removal of the files, you can manually trigger garbage-collection:
       ```
       git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all
       git gc --prune=now
       ```
      If you check `du -sh .git/objects` again after this operation, you will see that the size of
      the Git object store is now down to < 40 KB! All the files now tracked by LFS have been
      deleted from it.

4. At the root of the `exercise_6` directory (i.e. outside of the `arctic_animals.git` repo), you
   should find an untracked file named `animal_humpback_whale.bmp`. Add this image to the Git repo
   as an LFS-tracked file (please place it in the correct subdirectory). Then make a new commit
   for it on the `dev` branch.  
   When the commit is made, go back to the `master` branch.  
   <br>

5. We would now like to push this repository to GitHub. For this you will first need to create a  
   new empty repo on GitHub.

   Go to your GitHub account and create a new **private repo** named `arctic_animals`. If needed,
   you can have a look at the help slides for exercise 4 to get detailed instructions on how to do
   this. Since we will be importing an existing repo, don't add any file upon initialization of the
   repo on GitHub.

6. Push your changes on both `master` and `dev` to the remote. Remember that for this you will
   need to:
    * Add the newly created repo on GitHub as a remote to your local repo with:
      `git remote add origin https://github.com/<GitHub user name>/arctic_animals.git`
    * Use the `-u/--set-upstream` option of the push command the first time you push a new branch
      to the remote (this defines an upstream reference for the branch).
   <br>

   After you completed the push, have a look at your repository on GitHub. You should now see
   that all your files have been pushed to GitHub, and if you click on a file tracked by Git LFS,
   its content should not be displayed - instead you should see a "Stored with Git LFS " message.

7. Now that all files have been pushed to the remote on GitHub, we can safely clear unnecessary
   files from the local Git LFS cache (e.g. files that are in the history but not part of the
   current working tree).
    * Try to first run the relevant command in "dry run" mode.
    * How many files were deleted and how much disk space could you reclaim?  
   <br>

8. Let's now put ourselves in the shoes of another user of our `arctic_animals` repository.
   For this you should clone the repository in a different location of your file system.
   After you cloned your repository (you should be on branch `master` by default),
    * What is the size of the `.git/objects` and `.git/lfs` directories in your newly cloned repo?
      Compare it to the size of these directories your original repo.
    * Why is there this difference of size?  
   <br>


### Additional task: test a "force" push to your repo.
9. Go back to your original repo (not the copy) and switch/checkout the `master` branch.
   Looking at the history of the branch, you should see that its latest commit is a commit that
   removed emperor and Gentoo penguins from the repo.
   While this was a smart move - these penguins are not found in the arctic - the author of the
   commit unfortunately forgot to also delete these two species from the `birds/bird_list.txt`
   file.  

   Your task is to:
    * Fix the last commit on `master` by removing the two species from the `birds/bird_list.txt`
      file.
    * Rebase branch `dev` on `master` after the fix.  
   <br>

   When this is completed, you can push your modifications on `master` and `dev` to the remote:
    * Start by trying a regular push: `git push master` or `git push dev`.
    * Since we modified the history of our branches, git will not let us do a regular push...
      so run the `git push` command again but adding the option to allow history overwriting on
      the remote.

<br>

### Cleanup:
When you are done with your exercise, you can delete your repo on GitHub, so you don't waste some
precious storage space:

 * In your repo on GitHub, go to **Settings**.
 * Scroll to the bottom of the page. You will see a **"Danger Zone"** box.
   Click on **"Delete this repository"**.
